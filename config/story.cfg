text: Congratulations on your 18th birthday!\nFrom your savings, you have bought a small piece of grassland with a shed on it, to house the horse you saved from the slaughterhouse. Your parents are a bit concerned about this choice of yours, but as it has always been your dream to run a horse stable, they have decided to support you. They will loan you 500 a month until you can support yourself. Don't worry about the money for now though, go and have a look at your beautiful horse, it's in the stable.

text: Meet your horse! Here you can see how your horse is doing, and care for it. Might I suggest giving it a name, and then feeding and watering? It must be thirsty by now!

text: Now that you've spent some time with your horse, it might be a good idea to explore a bit. Right now, your headquarters are not much more than a noteblock with some scribles, but it's the place to be if you want to plan anything. Go ahead and take a look!
